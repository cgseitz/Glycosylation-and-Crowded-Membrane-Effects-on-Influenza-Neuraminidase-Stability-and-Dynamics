1) this section contains info on the RMSD, RMSF and head tilting work

2) the three directories contain the input pdbs, psfs and dcds used after solvent and lipids were removed

3) the trajectory files are too big to host on Github, but can be provided upon request. They are prepared and placed in a special folder if anyone needs them!
