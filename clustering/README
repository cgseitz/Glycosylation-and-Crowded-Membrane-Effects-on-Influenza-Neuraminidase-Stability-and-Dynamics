1) I concatenated the glycosylated and unglycosylated replicates so I just had one very long glycosylated trajectory and one very long unglycosylated one for my clustering
these trajectories are aligned to all alpha carbons

2) ran clustering with alpha carbons as the input and the whole system as the output
gmx cluster -f glycosylated.trr -s subset.pdb -g clustering.log -dist clusteringdistance.xvg -sz clusteringsize.xvg -cl finalclusters.pdb -cutoff 0.2 -method gromos

note that 0.2 is 0.2 nm, or 2 angstroms

I will start with increments of 0.2, and if I want to add more and reduce it to 0.1 later I can

if this takes too long I will stride them. I started the first one on 4/4/23. If I stride them, I should do it in a way that I can also incorporate the virion trajectories.
Actually I can do all the calculations on all three and then normalize the single protein ones to fit the virion ones, that way I'd be including more data in the calculations
I should do a bunch of tests with the virion one to find out what are good values to be running with the cutoff. Perhaps 0.2 is way too low and I should be starting with 1 or something like that and going further
