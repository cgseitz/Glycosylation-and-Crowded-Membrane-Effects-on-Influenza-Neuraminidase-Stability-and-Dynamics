1) donwloaded flexome from the email to my chicago address on 2/20/2023 and unzipped it

2) bash compileObjects.sh
bash compileExecutables.sh
to compile stuff

3) open the protein pdb in pymol and save it out, this will reformat it so that it can be read by the subsequent scripts

4) I need to create some files for each pdb that will be used later. I can make them like this:
./../../../ForDistribution23112020/CPP/pdb2bonds grep1_0ns_pymol.pdb

5) I will test the protein rigidity over several energy cutoffs. The idea here is that if more residues survive over higher cutoffs in one system vs the other, then the system with more surviving residues must have stronger bonds between each other and thus must be more rigid. 

easiest to do this with the loopRCD.sh. I copied that into my working directory, and on line 24 adjusted the path of pdbRCD so that it could find the executable. Specifically, I changed it to this: ./../ForDistribution23112020/CPP/pdbRCD

I then ran it like this:
bash loopRCD.sh unglycosylated_pymol.pdb
using energies from -0.5 to -5 in increments of 0.5

5) I can count the number in each primary cluster like this:

grep " CA " glycosylated_pymol_cut0.5.pdb | wc -l #this will tell you how many alpha carbons are in the entire protein

grep " CA " glycosylated_pymol_cut0.5.pdb | grep " 0.01 " | wc -l #this will tell you how many alpha carbons fit within the energy cutoff

6) doing this
pymol glycosylated_pymol_cut4.0.pdb colourFlexRCDs.pml
shows colours and representations based on the b column (i.e. colours which are the biggest clusters still there that haven't been cut off). Doing this with different cutoff levels shows how the retained clusters decrease at higher energy levels.
