Files for the paper "Glycosylation and Crowded Membrane Effects on Influenza Neuraminidase Stability and Dynamics" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.10.556910v2). Each of these folders contain the scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks needed to run the analyses for oneself. The source protein structure and trajectory files are often too large to host here, but they can be provided upon request. If you run into issues trying to run these analyses, or would like more information or more files, please do not hesitate to open an ```Issue``` or make a ```Pull request``` on the upper left part of this directory as this repository is checked regularly, or send an email to cseitz@ucsd.edu.
