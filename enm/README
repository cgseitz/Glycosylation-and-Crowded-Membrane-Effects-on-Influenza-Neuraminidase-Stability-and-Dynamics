The ProDy developer requested that I use prody from github, as that should work with the large system. To do this,

1) forked prody on github into my account

2) cloned prody on my terminal with
git clone https://github.com/prody/ProDy.git

3) exported prody into my python path with
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$/net/gpfs-amarolab/cseitz/from_jam/projects/phage/2_simulation_files/prody/ProDy

4) set up prody with
make build

5) allowed for the running of prody applications anywhere with
export PATH=$PATH:$/net/gpfs-amarolab/cseitz/from_jam/projects/phage/2_simulation_files/prody/ProDy/scripts

6) this still does not work in jupyter notebooks, but this is likely because it finds the conda installed prody which is not updated

7) which prody
/software/repo/python/anaconda3/bin/prody

8) Removed the conda prody
conda remove prody

9) which prody
/software/repo/python/anaconda3/bin/prody

10) rm /software/repo/python/anaconda3/bin/prody

11) jpnotebooks

12) export PYTHONPATH=/net/gpfs-amarolab/cseitz/from_jam/projects/phage/2_simulation_files/prody/ProDy$PYTHONPATH
this is needed to show python where to find the prody executable, and must be run before loading prody

13) asked Bryan to remove prody from python/site-packages because that is where jupyter notebook was finding it

14) reinstalled with conda

15) need to get jupyter notebook to find the python path of the prody module, maybe by adding it to the python path? unclear
conda list shows the prody module at /home/cseitz/miniconda3/bin
but jupyter notebook and python3 show the sys.path as at /software/repo/python/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages

16) Ran export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$/home/cseitz/miniconda3/bin to add the conda packages to the python path

17) changed the path direction in the jupyter notebook so that it pip installs to only the user in the notebook

18) created a new conda environment with conda create -n prody prody. Opening the notebook in this conda environment showed James' latest software updates!

19) when trying to run the ANM, it gave me this error:
RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 0xe but this version of numpy is 0xd
Clearly, my version of numpy is not as recent as the prody version. So outside of jupyter notebook but still in the conda environment, I ran conda update numpy. This allowed the ANM to work!!
